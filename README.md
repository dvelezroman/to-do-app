# to-do-app
A TODO app for mobile
Making a TODO app...let us see what awesome can I do in this...
Integration with Redux was a piece of cake...
Also have integration with FLUX... can RUN the app with one of them.

I think FLUX is easier than REDUX, bacause you do't need declarate mapStateToProps neither mapDispatchToProps.

Depends the needs a project has the election of REDUX or FLUX (REDUX is a branch of FLUX).
